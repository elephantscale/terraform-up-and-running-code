# Terraform: Up & Running Labs

This repo is the Elephant Scale's fork that we use for training. It is based on the one by Yevgeniy Brikman, as below.

This repo contains the code samples for the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)*,
2nd edition, by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).


## Labs

All labs are in the `labs` folder. There are accompanying slides explaning what to do in the labs, inquire at Elephant Scale :)

## Quick start

All the code is in the [code](/code) folder. It is organized by language (terraform, bash, ruby, etc) and within each
language, by chapter. Since this code comes from a book about Terraform, the vast majority of the code consists of
Terraform examples in the [code/terraform folder](/code/terraform). 

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the 
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book. 



## More examples

The example code in *Terraform: Up and Running* are mostly for Amazon Web Services (AWS). There is a project underway
to translate these examples to their equivalents on other cloud providers, such as Google Cloud and Azure, here:
