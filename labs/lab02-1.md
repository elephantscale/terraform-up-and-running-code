# Lab 02-1: Create a configurable web server

### Overview
* Use variable to configure your web server

### Depends On
* lab01.md

### Run time
* 20 minutes

## Step 1: Prepare the project

* Create a folder `labs/lab02-1` on your computer
* Place the `main.tf` file in this folder
* Following work is in the `main.tf`

## Step 2: Require `terraform` version between 0.12 and 0.14

    terraform {
      required_version = ">= 0.12, <= 0.14.8"
    }
    
## Step 2: Declare AWS provider

    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-east-2"
    
      # Allow any 2.x version of the AWS provider
      version = "~> 2.0"
    }

## Step 3: Make server port configurable using Terraform variable
    
    variable "server_port" {
      description = "Server port for HTTP requests"
      type        = number
      default     = 8080
    }
    
## Step 4: Declare the AMI instance to be created
 
    resource "aws_instance" "app" {
      instance_type     = "t2.micro"
      availability_zone = "us-east-2a"
      ami               = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"

* This fragment is continuing in the next step

## Step 5: For that instance, place the code for the web server using `user_data`
      user_data = <<-EOF
                  #!/bin/bash
                  sudo service apache2 start
                  EOF
    } 
    
## Step 6: Execute plan

* Run the following commands
    
        terraform plan
        terraform apply    
      
## Step 7: Execute plan      
* Verify the result on Amazon dashboard
* Login to AWS dashboard
* Analyze every element you created
        
## Step 8: Cleanup
* Run the following commands

        terraform destroy    
        
## Step 9: Debug
* Observe that you do not have the key and cannot login into the instance
* Research and find out how to give the instance a key
* Debug:
    * Re-run the configuration with the key
    * login into the instance
    * verify the curl operation from the inside
