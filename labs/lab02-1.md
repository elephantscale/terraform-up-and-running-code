# Lab 02-1: Create a web server

### Overview
* Create a web server

### Depends On
* None

### Run time
* 30 minutes

## Step 1: Prepare the project

* Create a folder `labs/lab02-1` on your computer
* Place the `main.tf` file in this folder
* Following work is in the `main.tf`

## Step 2: Code

* Specify terraform and provider

```hcl-terraform

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 3.3.0"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.14"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}
```

* Describe the instance to run

```hcl-terraform

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  instance_type     = "t2.micro"
  availability_zone = "us-east-2a"
  ami               = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              echo "Hello, World" > index.html
              nohup busybox httpd -f -p 8080 &
              EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-web-server"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Verify

* Run the following commands
    
        terraform plan
        terraform apply    
      
* Verify the result on Amazon dashboard
* Login to AWS dashboard
* Analyze every element you created

# What's missing? 

* Security group! (Coming up)
        
* Run the following commands

        terraform destroy    
        
## Step 4: Debug (optional)

* Observe that you do not have the key and cannot login into the instance
* Research and find out how to give the instance a key
* Debug:
    * Re-run the configuration with the key
    * login into the instance
    * verify the curl operation from the inside
